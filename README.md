# Polylang Comments Merger
**Merges comments from all translations of the posts in Polylang.**

[Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) creates posts and pages for each language. Comments posted on one language do not appear on other posts published in other languages.

*Polylang Comments Merger* merges comments from all Polylang translations of posts and pages, so that they all are displayed on each other. No changes are made to the db: comments remain internally attached to the post or page they were made on

## Installation
No special installation is required:
 - Upload the whole `polylang-comments-merger` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
 - Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress.

## Options ##
This plugin does not have any options. After activation all features are immediately available.

## What types of content are supported
Only posts and pages are supported.

## Notes
Polylang Comments Merger is heavily inspired by the no longer maintained [WPML Comment Merging](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpml-comment-merging/) plugin by Fabian Lange.
